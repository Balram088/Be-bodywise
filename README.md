PROJECT (Bebodywise Website Clone)
This blog is a short explanatory blog of our experience on making our own website clone . we would love to share our experience of working on a project assigned to us by Masai School. The goal was to clone the website — “bebodywise.com” and successfully apply our skills that we learned so far. I have to say it was far more difficult than I thought it would be. We learned what cannot be taught , but it must be experienced.

HOW WE DID IT
Before answering the big question of “ how we did it? ”, let me show you some images of our website.

THE CHALLANGES WE FACED :

When we were working on the main page, we had to skip some content in the midsection of the page, because of some of the properties of the font in the content, some part of it started misaligning with each other.
We faced some issues in Github when we were trying to push and merge the files we created.
Even after getting a couple of suggestions from our mentors, we were still facing issues while pushing, merging files, looking after the conflicts, and creating branches.
Even this time, while making the pricing page we went through some alignment issues which cost us little time but in the end, we worked it out.
As we mentioned above, we were able to complete only 6pages, at last, we tried our best to work it out with other pages too, but due to time shortage, it didn’t happen.
We were facing issues in the DOM part of the project and the media queries as these concepts are quite complicated to understand compared to HTML and CSS.
HOW WE OVERCAME THEM:

We skipped some parts of the content on the main page to get its properties and styles perfectly aligned with each other.
After getting a couple of suggestions from our mentors and trying, again and again, we were finally able to solve the Git issue on Day3.
Even while working on the pricing page, we faced alignment issues, but instead of skipping the content, we dived into the concepts and were finally able to overcome the issue.
We were facing issues in the media query section of the website so thought of skipping it as time was too short to perform the query part of the site which would have taken longer.
It was wonderful experience. Thankyou for reading :))
